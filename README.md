## ✨ Features

*   **Modern, Elegant UI:** A refined aesthetic with smooth transitions, glassmorphism elements, and a harmonious color palette designed to emphasize the beauty of the floral creations.
*   **Performance First:** Advanced image optimization strategies implemented from the ground up to ensure blazing-fast load times.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing experiences.
*   **Interactive Gallery:** A custom-built, responsive masonry-style gallery featuring an interactive lightbox for viewing high-resolution images.
*   **Optimized Image Delivery:**
    *   **Automated WebP Conversion:** Next-generation image formats generated automatically using the Sharp API.
    *   **Responsive `srcset`:** Dynamically serves the right image size (480w, 800w, 1200w, or 1920w) depending on the user's screen size and device profile.
    *   **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Prevention:** Explicit dimensions prevent content jumping.
    *   **Skeleton Loading:** Smooth shimmer animations (`pulse`) display natively while images load, avoiding blank spaces.
    *   **Eager & Lazy Loading:** The LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Hero image is eagerly preloaded, while off-screen components are lazy-loaded to save bandwidth.

*   **🛡️ Robust CI/CD Workflow:** 
    *   **Automated Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automatically lints and type-checks code on all pushes and pull requests.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Continuous security monitoring of NPM dependencies using `npm audit`.
    *   **Secret Detection:** Gitleaks action ensures no passwords or API tokens are accidentally committed.
    *   **Dependabot:** Automated weekly PR generation for dependency and ecosystem updates.
    *   **Seamless Deployment:** Native Vercel integration generates staging environments for PRs and zero-downtime production deployments for `main`.
